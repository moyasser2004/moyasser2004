- 🚀 Currently on a journey to master Flutter, Java, SQL, PowerShell, Python, R, C++, and Dart—because why pick just one?
- 📱 My heart beats for mobile app development, while my brain loves the puzzles of Data Science.
- 🌐 Connect with me on LinkedIn and let’s exchange ideas, or maybe even build something amazing together!
- ⚡ Fun Fact: Coding isn’t just a skill; it's my superpower. I’m always diving into the latest tech trends, hungry to learn something new and exciting!
